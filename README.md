Task-2 Image data

## Project Description
This project focuses on image data processing and analysis.
The goal is to convert an RGB image to a pencil sketch using Python. 
The process involves converting the image to grayscale, inverting the grayscale image,
and blending it with a blurred version to create the pencil sketch effect.

## Key Terms and Explanations
1. RGB Image Format:
   - RGB image format refers to the representation of colors in an image using the primary colors: Red, Green, and Blue.
   - Images are composed of pixels, where each pixel is assigned a combination of red, green, and blue values to create various colors.

2. Grayscale Image:
   - A grayscale image represents shades of gray ranging from black to white.
   - Unlike RGB images, grayscale images use only one channel to represent different levels of brightness.

3. Inversion of Grayscale Image:
   - Inverting a grayscale image involves reversing the brightness values.
   - It can enhance image details and is often used for artistic effects.

4. Pencil Sketch Generation:
   - Pencil sketch creation involves combining the grayscale image with an inverted, blurred version.
   - This is achieved by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image using the cv2 library in Python.

## Learning and Future Applications
By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience in image processing and analysis using Python. 
Some potential applications and benefits of this project include:
- Developing skills in manipulating image data for various purposes.
- Understanding the concept of color representation in digital images.
- Exploring different image filters and effects.
- Learning how to utilize libraries like cv2 for image processing tasks.
- Building a foundation for more advanced computer vision and image analysis projects in the future.

## Usage and Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Place your RGB image file in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Update the image file name in the Python script if necessary.
5. Run the Python script.
6. The output, a pencil sketch of the input image, will be saved in the project directory.
7. Feel free to customize the code or experiment with different images to explore various effects.
